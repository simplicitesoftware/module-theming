`SimThemes` module definition
=============================

# Introduction

This module contains additional themes that can be used for any Simplicité's instance.

## Purpose

The goal of such themes is either to give a more personal aspect to Simplicité's interfaces (matching a specific style or color palette) or to enhance some aspects of it to tailor the interfaces to any user.
Such themes can also serve more advanced requirements like web-accessibility (as much as possible), or graphic identities, thus ensuring consistency among all instances and external personal solutions.

## Datasets

Using the datasets in this module you can quickly set the theme to few predefined Home views:
1. Designer views, for all designers/makers using Simplicité, 2 datasets are available for Light/Dark.
2. Demo views, each dataset setting Light/Dark to both the User & Admin Home views in the Demo Scope.

## Details
- __ThemeMondrian :__ Based on Simplicité's new graphic chart from the rebranding and website rework.
	- 2 themes are available, Light & Dark, both have the same accent colors and keep similar color hierarchies in order to easily go from one to another if wanted.
	- Those themes are inspired by the strong technologic aspect of 80/90's with an emphasize on code-editor colors for accents. With inspirations from Mondrian's work for the structuration, using colored lines to emphasize on specific elements, bringing a touch of "simplicité".
- __ThemeAccessibility :__ Based on RG3A & WCAG norms for web-accessibility, this theme provides all the required contrasts & sizes.
	- 2 themes are available, Light & Dark, using same B&W colors (texts and backgrounds) and having similar bases for accent colors.
	- Both themes are also 'echoing' Simplicité's identity at least for the colors. Otherwise their primary focus is to be RGAA-friendly and passing web-accessibility norms.
